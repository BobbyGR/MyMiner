# MyMiner
MyMiner Application

This application is to help people mine coins with your windows computer.  You will add your own pools and mine coins to your wallet.
This application will help you keep the application running or mine while your computer is idle.  It's made to be free. This application
will never cost money.  I will never ask for a penny.  I will never ask for a fee.  You worked hard, and I was going to make this for 
myself regardless.  I'm just sharing.  Please join us on the discord channel to help me test!

When this goes to beta it will be released for Open Source.  Until then i'm keeping my crappy code to myself!
(It's bad, but it works)

You are better than batch files...you know it..I know it
