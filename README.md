## What Does AIOMiner Do?

Cryptocurrency mining has increased both as a topic and activity as cryptocurrency usage itself has grown exponentially in the last few years.

Each time a cryptocurrency transaction is made, a cryptocurrency miner, like AIOMiner, is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of information and updating the blockchain with the transaction. The mining process itself involves competing with other cryptominers to solve complicated mathematical problems with cryptographic hash functions that are associated with a block containing the transaction data.

The first cryptocurrency miner to crack the code is rewarded by being able to authorize the transaction, and in return for the service provided, cryptominers earn small amounts of cryptocurrency of their own. 

AIOMiner makes cryptomining SIMPLE! You can even run it on your standard PC or gaming rig.

## FAQ

Q1) Is it safe?

A1) Of course! But don't take it from us. Here's a 3rd party analysis on the software: [https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/e8f518e55783a853659938ed1c25f441acf5c8cf2e7730ce3135f2dd231759b2?environmentId=120](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/e8f518e55783a853659938ed1c25f441acf5c8cf2e7730ce3135f2dd231759b2?environmentId=120)

Q2) Can I receive reward payment to my Coinbase account?

A2) Yes, you can! Add a pool (Pool/Coin Settings) and input your Coinbase address. This also applies to any crypto wallets that you have such as [Jaxx Liberty](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liberty.jaxx&hl=en_US&gl=US) or other.

Q3) Am I limited to the miners that come with AIOMiner?

A3) No, you can add whatever miner you want and mine whatever coin you want. And run your own website local/public to manage your nodes/rigs. Or if someone runs the site,  you can connect to them to manage.

Q4) What is Donate coin?

A4) While we'll never ask, the Donate coin is setup to donate some ETH. We are fully committed to keeping mining free for everyone, but it does cost some money to keep the servers up and running. The Donate coin helps with paying those costs.

It goes to this account, 0x07bC4d2a376b770b69156f6f1616dbc033a94395.
